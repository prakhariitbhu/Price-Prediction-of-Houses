# Price-Prediction-of-Houses

- Created a linear regression model that predicts the prices of houses based on
different features such as per capita crime rate by town, proportion of non-retail
business acres per town, index of accessibility to radial highways, etc.
- The dataset that is used is loaded from sklearn itself.
